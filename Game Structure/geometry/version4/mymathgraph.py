    is a structure amounting to a set of objects in which some pairs of the
    objects are in some sense "related". The objects correspond to mathematical
    abstractions called vertices (also called nodes or points) and each of the
    related pairs of vertices is called an edge (also called link or line).[1]
    Typically, a graph is depicted in diagrammatic form as a set of dots or
    circles for the vertices, joined by lines or curves for the edges. Graphs
    are one of the objects of study in discrete mathematics."""
